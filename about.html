               <h3>Embracing emotional intelligence</h3>
               <p>sutranovum is a business dedicated to breathing in the enlightened future now. It is already here. We play our parts by believing in it, imagining it, seeing it, living it in. By embracing what is hidden we celebrate what may once have been deemed impossible. We are a global organization celebrating your awakened potential. We are dedicated to sharing insights on how your emotional state creates the world without.</p>
               <p>Our motto is:</p>
               <p><span>different space inside - different space outside</span></p>
               <p>A brand dedicated to seeing with new eyes, to the spirit of levity and emotional intelligence. We recognize that:</p>
               <p><span>gratitude is a muscle: use it</span></p>
               <p>We affirm that true leadership is born from the blossoming of      genuine vision and from recognizing the divine presence within.
                We are an educational foundation dedicated to celebrating our wonderful healed hearts and minds - liberated of their self-deception and most intimate with their passion, peace and generosity of spirit. We embody Emerson’s dictum that:</p>
                <p><span>“The way to mend the bad world is to create the right world.”
                </span></p>
                <p>sutranovum was born from the awareness that humility, faith and imagination can rise to any challenge and that trust frees the mind.
                We offer private coaching for individuals and businesses, training programs, events geared toward embracing wise approaches to ourselves and our environment, we are an inspired publisher and we have a limited edition gallery and expansive shop dedicated to the talk we walk. We develop narrative based technology.</p>

                    <br/>

                    <br/>All our products we develop in house with various partners.
                    <br/>
                    We follow the wisdom of: "Does this thing bring me joy?"and "Less is more." <b>We believe in refinement. If you have a bag - have a strong well designed one that lasts. at is multi-purpose. This seems to follow a trend of returning to quality merchandise. Products that are durable and that are made well.</b> For example: we make sure that our yoga pants are super durable, comfortable and stylish.
                    <br/>
                    <hr>
                    We source all our products sustainably and when we finish a design we profile it on a crowdfunding platform and on our shop and that way we only produce what we sell, what the market wants. All our products are not about cheap. They are about durable. And very well-designed. That is our focus. We welcome design ideas too.
                    <br/>
                    We have raw silk yoga pants in production. We have babies clothes on the table. We have a number of bag designs being prototyped. We are a shop and yet we follow the now growing trend that "less is more." Our philosophy is quality over quantity. You don’t need ten pairs of jeans. You need two really good ones. We focus on that kind of product and that kind only. You pay more - but they are exclusive and of the highest quality, You don’t need crap. You don’t need 20 bags - you need three good ones. ‘What you buy might as well be high quality. Why compromise? You are the artisan of your life. Not it’s victim. You figure out how to do it right and enjoy the process.” That’s the philosophy we expound. That’s the nuts and bolts of our business model too.
                    <br/>
                    For the last couple years there has been a trend in San Francisco. The thrift stores here like Good Will have had to turn a lot of donations away - Mary Kondo’s “does it bring you joy/ less is more model is hitting home. People want less crap. More Order. More out of life, to get down to the marrow and celebrate it. American Giant is a business that makes 150 dollar hoodies in San Francisco with Chinese American women and their hoodies are more than twice as good as the mass market ones out of sweat shops in China. They last at least twice as long and are more than twice as tough.
                    <br/>
                    These two trends are at the heart of our approach to all our products and services. They are well designed to the highest rugged standards.

                <p>True leadership is born from the blossoming of genuine vision and from recognizing the divine presence within. We focus on emotional intelligence and embracing vision in all areas of human experience and enterprise. All this is built around the awareness that it is far wiser to teach a man to fish than to give him fish and the insight that a cure is better than "solutions" that treat the symptoms only. This business vision is built around the recognition of the significance of emotional wisdom. We work with individuals, companies, governments, NGOs and international organizations.</p>

    <p>At the core of our work is the focus on celebrating the stories and the world we most wish to inhabit, by changing oneself first and foremost. We recognize that: when we start with complaining and worry, being overwhelmed, these things are like magnets for creating the opposite of what we are focused on achieving.

            <p>So we focus on emotional intelligence, gratitude, serenity, clarity...and from these things flower fulfillment. They are the pivots of our happy world. The one we construct through the axioms of our appreciation. We will it in by making it our focus. By being aligned with the deepest avenues of trust within us. When a human being is virtuous he is not informed by insecurity. His or her focus is on fulfillment. We have a conscious choice to be blinded by the illusionary specter of insecurity or to see through fulfilled eyes. We can naturally focus our attention on trust, gratitude and creative vision. We can dare to dream and see beyond distractions to what matters: to the human heart nurtured, emboldened, wisely attuned to the limitless mind and to the loving loyal hands that do its bidding.</p>
