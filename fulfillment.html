That quality of gratitude can change an inner world and send rip currents through the outer. What is worth knowing are the intricacies of fulfillment, the laws of what is internal.</p>
                    <p>Life consistent with this wisdom flows without mishap. It has been a facet of history that there is an underlying commitment to an unquestioned status quo. It has been yet another facet that there is an underlying commitment to question the status quo too. The balance of these two creates the mores of society. To create a fulfilled individual is a feat of conscious engineering, a product of an aligned destiny, of questioning and changing mores wisely, while maintaining tried and tested ones that are truly beneficial.</p>

Destiny is what we imagine our best selves to be - and the courage and dedication within to bringing that to the fore defines what it imparts us of ourselves, to ourselves. We achieve our goals of our best selves by taking aim at aligning with that inner state.</p>

                <p>Life is beautiful and profound. At its heart, it is a narrative, an ongoing collection of stories and characters that we are woven into, that we help weave. At sutranovum we take such truths to be self-evident. Stories and myths are about archetypes and allegory and they bubble up from potentials and needs and desires inside of us.   Allegory means the hidden meanings that exist in stories; what they secretly represent. Intelligence is a word from Latin: Inter-legere. To read between the lines. Emotional intelligence means to read between the lines of our experiences and our conversations with ourselves and others. It means to discern what is real and kind and wise.  A human being may inhabit different states. and coded into our experiences is the capacity of the human spirit to transcend upset and meaningless self-destructive emotions, expressions and behaviors. What is the value of tragedy? What is the significance of a nightmare? We wake in the middle of the night from a scary dream. Is it true? No, we dreamt it. It is an illusion. Upon awakening, we are relieved and grateful. Difficult and tragic things are woven into the tapestried process of experience so that we may remember who we are. Our greatest problems are intended to draw out of us our greatest triumphs. 
                </p>
                <p>- education - ex -out of - ducat-ducare - to pull means to 'draw or pull out of oneself' The news may be painted with our collective paranoia and fears, society may tell us we are worthless, it may point out everything that is wrong with us until we find out who we really are. For, the truth is, society merely mirrors our fears until we see who we are. Our job is not to fix the world or change other people, our job is to “live joyfully midst the sorrows of the world.” Buddha means ‘he who is awake." Jesus originates from Joshua and it means “that which saves.” Christ means ”anointed or blessed.”Art, science, friendship, teamwork, discipline, excellence, devotion, love, healing: all these things flower from the same root: self-awareness. When they blossom, something articulate, whole and real awakens in us.  To create a sustainable flourishing ecosystem demands love for the earth and for nature, out of which we spring. It is only right to love Mother Nature and Father Earth. To have reverence for life is intrinsic in all of us. It is the action of wisdom and integrity is to treasure reverence, to see it and nurture it and cultivate it.</p>
                <p>To heal ourselves of deception and upset we must master seeing ourselves as blessed. An awakened state of perception entails seeing that way on a consistent basis. This the basis of a healed framework of perception. To embrace gratitude and an identity liberated of in lack or fear happens when there is a continued dedication to that end, and when simultaneously, there is sufficient weariness of the alternative. </p>

That quality of gratitude can change an inner world and send rip currents through the outer. What is worth knowing are the intricacies of fulfillment, the laws of what is internal."</p>
