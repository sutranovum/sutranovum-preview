                    <p>Life is beautiful and profound. At its heart, it is a narrative, an ongoing collection of stories and characters that we are woven into, that we help weave. At sutranovum we take such truths to be self-evident. Stories and myths are about archetypes and allegory and they bubble up from potentials and needs and desires inside of us.   Allegory means the hidden meanings that exist in stories; what they secretly represent. Intelligence is a word from Latin: Inter-legere. To read between the lines. Emotional intelligence means to read between the lines of our experiences and our conversations with ourselves and others. It means to discern what is real and kind and wise.  A human being may inhabit different states. and coded into our experiences is the capacity of the human spirit to transcend upset and meaningless self-destructive emotions, expressions and behaviors. What is the value of tragedy? What is the significance of a nightmare? We wake in the middle of the night from a scary dream. Is it true? No, we dreamt it. It is an illusion. Upon awakening, we are relieved and grateful. Difficult and tragic things are woven into the tapestried process of experience so that we may remember who we are. Our greatest problems are intended to draw out of us our greatest triumphs.

                    <p>- education - ex -out of - ducat-ducare - to pull means to 'draw or pull out of oneself' The news may be painted with our collective paranoia and fears, society may tell us we are worthless, it may point out everything that is wrong with us until we find out who we really are. For, the truth is, society merely mirrors our fears until we see who we are. Our job is not to fix the world or change other people, our job is to âlive joyfully midst the sorrows of the world.â Buddha means âhe who is awake." Jesus originates from Joshua and it means âthat which saves.â Christ means âanointed or blessed.âArt, science, friendship, teamwork, discipline, excellence, devotion, love, healing: all these things flower from the same root: self-awareness. When they blossom, something articulate, whole and real awakens in us.  To create a sustainable flourishing ecosystem demands love for the earth and for nature, out of which we spring. It is only right to love Mother Nature and Father Earth. To have reverence for life is intrinsic in all of us. It is the action of wisdom and integrity is to treasure reverence, to see it and nurture it and cultivate it.</p>
                    <p>To heal ourselves of deception and upset we must master seeing ourselves as blessed. An awakened state of perception entails seeing that way on a consistent basis. This the basis of a healed framework of perception. To embrace gratitude and an identity liberated of in lack or fear happens when there is a continued dedication to that end, and when simultaneously, there is sufficient weariness of the alternative. </p>

The meta view is where true healing really happens. Plato hinted at this in his book âThe Cage.â Cancer will not be cured by doctors (this is like the inhabitants of Platoâs Cave looking for meaning in the shadows on the wall) but by seeing the fearful thoughts that create those things in the body - fear literally eating oneself up from the inside.

Love is what we are; our essential nature. In essence, love is trust.</p>

                        <p>Trust implies seeing beyond the mind that worries. It means embracing the imaginative vistas of what is wise.And that means nurturing the seeds of our inner growth, as is in accord with nature and our natural faculties.</p>

Why should we value philosophy? Not Buddhist philosophy or Greek philosophy. But our own - why should we value our own life philosophy? And what exactly is a life philosophy? Do we teach it in schools. do our parents teach it to us? Who taught it to them? What is emotionally wise? These are the kind of questions that seem pretty elemental to embracing life fully.</p>

                            <p>Philosophy literally means âlove of wisdom.â It is the bedrock of existence. When we are in love with a child or with ourselves or with another, we are happy. And with love comes wisdom. Love is the flower, wisdom its perfume. It is absolutely essential to what we do as human beings. When we are in love with wisdom, when we come to be wise our consciousness is neither restricted nor deceived. To see clearly and to embrace clear priorities - means to be engaged with what is ascendant in the human being.</p>

                            <p>This is a passage (with some commentary) from the Boston Transcript cited in The Gospel of Emerson, edited by Newton Dillaway, a book that was printed and published in the 1930s and 40s:</p>  
                            <div class='borderL'>
                                <p>"Mr Dillaway sees the primacy of the spiritual not through a glass darkly."</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>To be authentically happy, to be inspired - inspired means to be in spirit.</p>

                            <p>'not through a glass darkly' is looking at what shines out of us head on. Wisdom and love are what shine. What make us shine as beings.</p>

                            <p>Not living a life wherein there are these diminishing returns on this happy balance within. But, rather, becoming consistently more and more situated in it.</p>
                            <div class='borderL'>
                                <p>"Emerson, he says, knew the real reason for the decline of the church, the state, art, letters, life, in modern times. He did not look for the surface causes, but plumbed to the heart of things, seeing that the loss of this primary faith in what is in you and me is the real cause of the decline of Western civilization. That he sought to re-establish a primary faith in the Supreme Spirit that is in every man."</p>

                                <p>"How strange a blunderer is man in the plain face of all this. Here is the gift of infinitude within him, and he pushes it away from the center of his life. He prefers with low mean choice, to put the pleasures of the flesh..., in the center;or the acquisition of things by centralising the strife of shrewdness and cunning that makes him subhuman; or he becomes immersed in the intellectual and aesthetic professional duties until these crowd out completely the spirit and its nurture from its rightful center. And so one may multiply lopsided people. In the center one sees the thing which ought to be on the perimeter, and out on the rim of the personality, almost sloughed off, that which is spiritual."</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>To be spiritual is to be emotionally wise, intelligent to one's implicit inner nature. Fear builds walls, takes offence, fields defence, justifies enmity and upset. To be guilty is a recipe for pain. Sexuality is an aspect of our nature. It is a healthy part of life, so while there is wisdom in what Mr Newton observes...we are generations on now. And we can embrace the best of what the likes of Emerson found growthful.</p>

                            <p>There is a certain capacity in those that see clearly.A rectifying quality. Makes sense that such individuals, people like you and I, just normal people living their lives,can fall in love with wisdom. The task of philosophy. To love wisdom. Wisdom cannot condemn. It can understand the value of gratitude. When married with imagination....the sky is no longer the limit. Such slants of perception can rebirth the world. As a species we are traveling out to other planets. We are embracing the solar system and beyond that even. Science will take us there and beyond. Which is amazing if you think about it. Just as the telephone is and the jets that broke the Mach 1 and then Mach 2 and 3....and on up...are.. to the moon...</p>

                        <p>Putting philosophy first delivers us into this investigation into what it means to be on this planet. What our roles are. As custodians of nature. Of this spaceship planet. Where war and conflict in general causes unnecessary suffering. War costs too much. That's a simple insight of our species. War is tense. War is the outcome of tension. War is the breakdown, the disconnect from a vantage point of wisdom. It seemssuited -a sane move to create a vibration wherein we are not deceived, where we prioritize wisdom. Focused self understanding and self awareness. That is what yields happy productive individuals. You are the world. In your world. So recognizing the value of your inner philosophy - seems key to plumbing the depths of yourself.</p>

                        <p>And the framework of our inner world creates the outer. So then the philosophy of our perception is key to the kind of life we have and the kind of world we manifest.</p>

                        <p>Life brings questions. You have the answers within you. That is the essence of philosophy; that we have free will. And to be wise is to use ones resources imaginatively. To go beyond our conflict zones takes emotional intelligence. It takes being able to see the application of gratitude for untold wonders. When we pause and become attentive conflict resolution makes sense.The stories we print matter. But if we don't value ourselves wisely - we lack the vigilance it takes to see how focusing on the positive is a highly prized skill. And like any skill it can be practiced. But it does demand seeing things in the right perspective, from the vantage point of wisdom.</p>

                        <p>From Alan Chadwick's Talk on Thymus or Thyme:</p>
                        <div class='borderL'>
                            <p>"The herb today is Thymus. Thymus serpyllum is what you would call the common wild thyme. It is perennial; it is governed by the sun...It is a perennial; it is governed by the sun...I'll describe the performance of the plant after talking about it...It is a revivifier of the spirit.The Greek word, thymos, which is what the thymus is derived from, crossing the threshold into the invisible world. If you take the plant sage, which gives us the word sagacity, here you've got a comprehensive plant related to thymus. They compliment each other. Now - sage, sagacity, wisdom - continues with man throughout life into old age. Thymus is the beyond. It always is the uplifting of the world and the light and the heat of the sun. It was always used as incense in Greece and embalmment in Egypt.</p>

                            <p>It grows as an alpine plant, as a rock plant, and it grows on undulating down, if not exceptionally good drainage, except not like bogland. It's an adorer of the sun, and as you know is very stalky, with little tiny leaves and little tiny flowers, and has this relationship to the marriage of the sun for warmth and blankets created by that marriage. The fragrance is out of this world, not in its, and its use is serenity. It grows then in alpine rocks, in very shallow soil, in turf amongst other plants, and is perfectly happy, is very low growing. It grows then in alpine areas over rocks, in very shallow soil, in turf amongst other plants, and is perfectly happy, is very low growing. There are several varieties of it, which we will talk a little about. But it is a very low-growing plant at all times and likes to grow in and for other plants. It is social. It can't bear to be topped, neither does it appreciate what you call a lot of water. And other than that, it grows anywhere from the African border of the Mediterranean up into Iceland, where it grows extremely well., and into Scandinavia and all of those mountain regions."</p>

                            <p>"It was inspired by a sermon with that title by my teacher, Paul Tillich: âThe Salvation of Natureâ. He made reference to the then newly formed science of survival and the endangerment of just about everythingâthe end of nature and the end of us. It was the late â50s, when scientists announced the formation of such a group, as if science could get us out of the fix, although even they must have had doubts about any recovery given the responsibility science has for the predicament. It must have confirmed for Tillich his description of âthe late stage of the self-destruction of industrial societyâ, a phrase I learned from him that became, for me, a kind of negative mantra, a fancy way of referring to an obsessive preoccupationâthe fate of the social order I had to call my own. Tillich makes clear that the scientists didn't mean the survival of humans, or the survival of endangered species, or the oceans, or the forests, or the airâthey meant the survival of the earth as we know it, our planet, largely ruled, as it is, by industrial society. It meant the fall of a very large orderâbigger than the Roman Empire."</p>

                            <p>Tillich mentions how the first time things turned sour, in the Biblical myth of the flood, God regrettedâthe word used is ârepentedââ what had come to pass with creation and caused a flood to wipe out almost everything; now, this time, we are doing it to ourselves. It is the Flood the second time around with ourselves to blame. Tillich was the only one I knew who used the phraseââthe late stage of the self-destruction of industrial societyââour societyâwhat he called âthe world above the given world of natureâ, long before the science of survival was proposed or environmental awareness had taken on anything like a national character, after the Earth Day event in 1970.</p>

                            <p>His formulation stuck in my mind. As a world above the given world of nature, industrial society is a sub-world, a reduced world, where science and technology are in charge as agents of self-destruction, under the ideological sway of Physicalism,the opponent of Vitalism. Physicalism is the reduction of everything to physical and chemical properties; Vitalism argues for the integrity of organic nature against the reduction. Physicalism defeated Vitalism in the early 19th century and now Vitalism has re-appeared in the environmental movement and a host of allied movements, what could be called a Neo-Vitalist revolution. The struggle has been re-enjoined even though Physicalists, or most scientists, having enjoyed a century and more of victorious rule, are reluctant to admit it. They see themselves as servants of industrial society devoted to its continuation, no matter what the cost. Universities are where these servants of industrial society are trained.</p>

                            <p>This is a bleak view. No wonder that instead of destined to direct history we think it our fate to suffer it.</p>

                            <p>By Paul A. Lee, Author of There is a Garden in the Mind</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Of Emerson, Newton Dellway wrote:</p>
                        <div class='borderL'>

                            <p>"With the coming of this oracle, the young man rose into the Creative Consciousness and began to speak as a Prophet. He was henceforth to serve as a vehicle of insight for molding a gospel of the New World.</p>

                            <p>And God liveth The word unto the prophet spoken was writ on tablet yet, unbroken, Still floats upon the morning wind, Still whispers to the willing mind."</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>A gospel is a book of beliefs.</p>
                        <p>Emerson "did not look for surface causes but plumbed to the heart of things, seeing that the loss if this primary faith in what is in you and me is the real cause of the decline of Western civilization. Thus he sought to re-establish a primary faith in the Supreme Spirit that is in every man." The realization that we all of us carry around a book of beliefs in our unconscious reminds us to pay careful attention what is our inner 'prophet spoken," The root meaning of prophet is this: from pro "before" (from PIE root *per- (1) "forward," hence "in front of, before") + root of phanai "to speak," from PIE root *bha- (2) "to speak, tell, say." In English, meaning "prophetic writer of the Old Testament" is from late 14c. Non-religious sense is from 1848.Essentially it means to to speak things in from before. Philosophy of perception - is basically owning that we, all of us, are speaking things into form, what stories and narratives we are telling ourselves day in and day out. How we act, how we think, how we feel, how we interact, how we look on one another. What we choose to demonstrate to our children. To ourselves.</p>

                        <p>Joseph Campbell, the comparative mythologist, had high hopes for humanity, he wrote:</p>
                        <div class='borderL'>
                            <p><i>âApocalypse does not point to a fiery Armageddon but to the fact that our ignorance and our complacency are coming to an endâ¦ The exclusivism of there being only one way in which we can be saved, the idea that there is a single religious group that is in sole possession of the truthâthat is the world as we know it that must pass away. What is the kingdom? It lies in our realization of the ubiquity of the divine presence in our neighbors, in our enemies, in all of us.â</i></p>
                            <p>Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>It is clear when we approach life with a certain sensitivity for the different narratives, the ones that make up the mores of a society, of farming and planning our daily lives, living as individuals within families and communities around the world then we can recognize the roles we play and prescribe new manners and roles to ourselves. When we demystify prophecy it means to recognize the significance of our preconceptions as that constitutes owning what the bounds of what our imagination and courage decree. Surely wisdom would see humanity flourishing, the earth being taken care of wise, attention to the dissolution of fear and the flowering of sensitivity.</p>

                       <p>Maybe you have a child. Maybe you love your child and you see their happiness as paramount. Maybe you have more than one child. And everyday your children go to school and have a test you say: 'Whatever you get in your test you will always be ten out of ten to me.' That kind of loving really sees the greatness in your child. What's greater than ten out ten? Children grow up to men and women. And if those children are loved in that way. holistically, wholeheartedly...they grow up to be great people.</p>

                        <p>Emerson wrote:</p>
                        <div class='borderL'>
                            <p><i>Great men, great nations, have not been boasters and buffoons, but perceivers of the terror of life, and have manned themselves to face it.â</i></p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Maybe it's only a terror if we let fear rule our heart, our minds, our lives. There are two things going on in our lives.</p>

                        <p>- Our inner life. - Our personal and professional lives; our outer life - the body is born, grows up, lives, has relationships with others and with nature and modernity.</p>

                        <p>There is an inner journey and an outer one. And wisdom is to be found in how we frame each. We can choose to perceive more harmony, less fighting over superficial symbols, more mature use of resources, more trusting economies. That seems most sensible as individuals and as a species.</p>

                        <p>There are banks in Southern India that are made of a bundle of 24 families or more or less. And they have known each other for centuries. And someone wants to go to college or put on a wedding, or pay for a funeral, or fix a kitchen....whatever it is everyone pays in and when you have a genuine need you ask and it is managed by all the families in the community. It's an economy based on trust. That was a product of a pre-industrial age. And those things still can be found in India. But, by and large, the corporate culture has taken over - all over the planet.</p>

                        <p>But the trust and strength of the bonds in a community like that are quite enriching to contemplate. How we might learn from different cultures the strengths and mores that bind us as communities, as business communities, as harmonious participators in living on planet earth. So there is this sense of family lives, working lives, and our lives related to nature, as custodians and as philosophers of how to use the resources of the land and the sea and the air. And how to honor it and each other: as husbands and wives, as children, as adults, as individuals, as friends, as relatives, as city and town dwellers, as nationals and as humans. There seems to be some sense, some correlation between inner contentment and outer balance.</p>

                        <p>Alan Chadwick who was a key figure in the birth of the organic farming movement in California in the 60s and 70s onwards, said in an interview in a garden once that "Nature adores man." There is good reason to embrace vitalism, this sense that life is invested with spirit. Not just a mechanical superficial reading of any given story. For in each human being, there is a growth toward connection, and ultimately, transcendance. And the narratives, inside and out, that we adhere to, will shape our stories and our present and our future.</p>

                        <p>So it makes sense to have an inner disposition expressly focused on philosophy and emotional intelligence. Because philosophy - love of wisdom - helps us to read between the lines of experience. And emotional wisdom means that we make manifest fulfilled lives and we live in harmony on the earth. And learn to become expert weavers of stories, hopeful stories, visionary stores. Stories that celebrate the greening of the earth and the beauty and the joy of living, the genius and goodness, the levity, the high spirits in your self, in all of nature,</p>

                        <p>There are tribes in Africa that prescribe uplifting stories for depressed spirits. Go wander in the forest and hear the dawn birds. See someone else's baby smile at you. See the sun rise. Raise a family. Go live in the woods. Whatever your life story may be. It makes abundant sense to focus on those stories that can envision and enact a renaissance.</p>

                        <p>Alan Chadwick on the herb Thyme - Thymus:</p>
                        <div class='borderL'>
                            <p><i>"It is enormously disliked by mites. All insects, literally birds. butterflies, bees have an adoration of this plant and the working of it. It has total effect upon atmosphere where you root it, where you know areas where it grows, the charm of sitting amongst it and the atmosphere it creates."</i></p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Thymus means spirited. What kind of atmosphere could our most prudent and happy and conscientious and spontaneous selves...our most fearless selves, create if given half the chance? That is the question that is at the heart of any good philosophy And the measure of how enriched and sophisticated and elevated our company is boils down to our disposition. And how we are disposed to be is a measure of refinement. And that is the meditation of culture. Our inner culture, our outer culture.What we have the courage to envision matters.</p>

                        <p>Different space inside Different space outside.</p>

                        <p>And we have free will to imagine in more blessed outcomes. That is the world we may wish to experience from the foundation of gratitude. These last two lines sum up our philosophy. The reach of these things is far and wide. And deep.</p>

Oscar Wilde wrote that <i>"Life is far too important to take seriously."</i> All these stories are allegories. An allegory is a story that is used to reveal a hidden meaning to be drawn out. It is a doorway that invites inquiry into our hidden potential. The heroes, mavericks and gods of a culture are there to be mirrors to our potentials. They are archetypes of the spirit.</p>

                            <p>Mythology comes from a deep place inside of man which recognizes that what can be spoken about is the penultimate truth. But it serves to activate and inspire man to reach for the stars. In the Power of Myth Joseph Campbell, the renowned Comparative Mythologist had this dialogue with the journalist Bill Moyers.</p>

                            <p><b>"JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</b> Myths are clues to the spiritual potentialities of the human life.</p>

                            <p><b>BILL MOYERS:</b> What weâre capable of knowing within?</p>

                            <p><b>BILL MOYERS:</b> I liked your defin-you changed the definition of a myth from the search for meaning to the experience of meaning.</p>

                            <p><b>BILL MOYERS:</b> The experience of life.</p>

                            <p><b>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</b><i> The experience of life. The mind has to do with meaning; in here, whatâs the meaning of a flower? That Zen story of the sermon of the Buddha when his whole company was gathered, and he simply lifted a flower. And thereâs only one man, Kashyapa, who gave him a sign with his eye that he understood what was said.</i></p>

                            <p><i>Whatâs the meaning of the universe? Whatâs the meaning of a flea? Itâs just there, thatâs it, and your own meaning is that youâre there. Now we are so engaged in doing things, to achieve purposes of outer value, that we forget that the inner value, the rapture that is associated with being alive, is what itâs all about.</i></p>

                            <p><i>Now, we want to think about God. God is a thought, God is a name, God is an idea, but its reference is to something that transcends all thinking. The ultimate mystery of being is beyond all categories of thought. My friend Heinrich Zimmer of years ago used to say, âThe best things canât be told.â Because they transcend thought. The second best are misunderstood, because those are the thoughts that are supposed to refer to that which canât be thought about, you know. And one gets stuck with the thoughts. The third best are what we talk about, you see. And myth is that field of reference, metaphors referring to what is absolutely transcendent."</i></p>

                            <p>A god is an authority figure and the ultimate authority figure is you. You make your decisions. You decided what is right for you and your family. So let us hope that your decisions are guided by faith in goodness and in love of self.</p>

                            <p>All myths, all art, all scientific endeavor and philosophy and commerce combine into the tapestry that is human society. And what binds it, what gives it intrinsic meaning is self-love. You are the heart of the universe. Your liberation from suffering and your alignment with your gifts and harmony in your relationships is the purpose of a well lived life aligned with wisdom and celebrating and activating human potential.

                            <p>The map is not the terrain. But whatever map you use, let it be one where you cherish and honor yourself and others and you are not guided by fear but by self-love and wisdom. That is key. And, that, in a sense, is the value of sutranovum - at its core: To see the woods for the trees. <b>To make contact with our most harmonious vision of ourselves, our families, our wider communities and our relationship with the earth.</b> To interpret. Wisely.</p>

                            <p>How we perceive and what we say and think and feel matters. It reveals who we take ourselves to be. With what eyes do we look?</p>

                            <p>"You have a crappy job." "You have a shitty relationship."</p>

                            <p>You look carefully at what is going on and you discern that mythology is allegory. For example:</p>

                            <p>Christ means "blessed."That's the meaning in the Aramaic. Jesus is from Joshua and that means to save. Jesus is the I am. Whatever we define ourselves to be. If we make our news focus on lack and deception - we further that story. If we go beyond this we come to ourselves emancipated of fear. So it behooves us to become emotionally intelligent to this. Holy ground. Holy man. Holy and holistic are connected words. Wholehearted activity. These are just words. But what they points to is not limited. Holistic. Wholehearted. Not divided. Not deceived. This means to have a harmonious relationship with nature. With ones own nature. With the cosmos. Whether you wake up in Idaho or Texas, whether you are young or old. you breathe life into your every moment. And when you stand under a flag. whatever flag is your flag...what does it stand for now? What does it embrace? Because you now are the standard bearer. And you decree what future we build.</p>

                            <p>They say of/to veterans: <i>"Thank you for your service."</i>Do you/we say it to the bus drivers that drive the city streets? To whom do you say it? They work damned hard. They keep the city moving. Men and women like that. Every city you go to. From the Ancient greek and before even....the battlefield has spilled blood. The myth of Babylon is a symbolic story. When you take Eritreans and Pakistanis and French and English and Germans and Irish and Guyanese and Jewish and Muslim and Hindu and Buddhist and Atheist, man and woman and child and you blend them and many more...you get America. And can we live in peace and harmony? A big country like America has bears. And the rifle played its part protecting man from bears. But maturity means we are aligned with the inspired spirit of the moment.</p>

                            <p>And maturity means enmity has no place in a wise economy. The animals have no enmity. So we really must be focused on the bird's eye of celebrating our strengths. It is elemental. And a celebration of a weakness is not a strength. The dawn, the kindness, the ingenuity, the forgiveness in man. These are holistic thinking, wholehearted feeling. We are 'blessed'/christened by what saves us/what we choose to define ourselves as.</p>

                            <p>That is the way of myth: as allegorical mirrors to our own lives. . And the death on the cross means the transcendence of fear - the rebirth - be it from manifesting a new job or a new partner or a new experience of both...whatever the focus - a new reality is incited...dawns - you let go of your fears, you die to them, you are reborn in the image of your new blessed state.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: left"><b>gratitude is a muscle - use it</b></p>

                            <p>In order to disentangle and disenthrall from fearful narratives we must see with vision. This means to see beyond the victim mind state. To drop it entirely. Leave it behind us. Forget it. Now. No more these needless indiscretions. To go beyond complaining; see with the eyes of gratitude.
                            <br/><br/>
                            <i>Heaven is spread upon the earth - yet men do not see it.'</i></p>
                            <img src='./assets/images/garden1.jpg' style="width:100%; height:600px"/>
                            <p>The option is there to see. To see it. The mirror (rational/unimaginative mind) says you are a little cat. Do you see the lion? To love we must know how to love ourselves. If we talk of time and worry, complain and sigh...well this malice, it is done to us. By us. But we can cease settling for what we are not. Recognize ourselves in the mirrors of faith,in those of our personal history, of what may be, of what is, of history, of the deepest wisdom. It takes a small match to light a fire. It takes a little courage, a little faith to start down a challenging path. It takes a slow run to start a sprint..., and irrepressible imagination to birth...what may not be reversed.</p>

                            <p>And when we start to run, what if we feel the gentle breeze of our passage forward, ladies and gentleman, what if we cannot stop what we have started?</p>

                            <p>The rocket tends to the heavens, the moth to the flame, but we cannot be consumed in the heat of our longing, we can only be used. Yet never spent, not once drained. What a wonderful blessing...that there are ever expanding treasures.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: left">Work is not the purpose of life. But it is essential to human dignity. To contribute. to collaborate. to create. This is what we do when our hearts and minds and hands are aligned. The word for hand in Latin is âmanus.â</p>
                            <img src='./assets/images/work1.jpg' style="width:100%; height:600px"/>

                            <p>From that word we get:</p>

                            <p><i>manifest destiny mandate manual manuscript manifest man</i></p>

                            <p>Our capacity to fashion things with our hands is critical to who we are.The heart talks to the head and the head to the hand and so the head aligned with the heart yields all harmony. When the heart is not attended to...then discord is certain. When the heart is heeded harmony is guaranteed.</p>

                            <img src='./assets/images/work2.jpg' style="width:100%; height:600px"/>

                            <p>How we prioritize emotional intelligence in the workplace dictates whether our options are to flourish or merely to survive. When a mother looks at her newborn child....her heart full of love...survival is not an option. All her heart wants is for her baby is to see it flourish.If you look at yourself in the same way, you are looking with the eyes of love. You begin to see why self-love is at the root of the tree we call wisdom.....</p>

                            <p style="text-align: left">'mores'</p>
                            <p><i>âthe essential or characteristic customs and conventions of a community"</i></p>

                            <p>The history of civilisation is the history of three buildings. The church or temple. The state or capital building. And the factory and skyscraper.. Religion. Governance. Business. All of these buildings are born of needs and aspirations within the human community. And all of them have their own mores.</p>

                            <p>Gods, presidents and business tycoons have ways of operating. And when we examine those ways or mores we find a mirror to our roadblocks and potentials as a species.</p>

                            <p>The French speak of the English speaking world as the Anglo-Saxon culture. The Chinese have a certain way of doing things, the Aborigines another. Traditionally in Ayurveda in India the first dish eaten is sweet because sweet food is considered the easiest to digest and gets the digestive juices working.</p>

                            <p>Mores matter - how we act and interact matters because we matter. A lot. sutranovum as an organization question our mores - as individuals, as cultures, as nationalities, as technologically savvy creatures. We do this because we recognize human beings matter and that when our mores are aligned with emotional intelligence profoundly helpful and uplifting shifts can flower in the mind of man, inspired by his most creative and liberated spirit, and spread like a fresh breeze through human culture and humanity at large.</p>
                            <img src='./assets/images/fresh1.jpg' style="width:100%; height:600px"/>

                            <p>In the 1980s and 90s Ricardo Semler was the Managing director of the Brazilian company Semco.</p>

                            <p>It was the longest period of inflation in modern times in Brazil. During that period with him at the helm of Semco he took the company from a million dollar company to a 100s of millions of dollars company.</p>

                            <p>How did he do it? He questioned the mores of the business culture he was in. He started to work with people as people not as job descriptions. He asked them if they were morning people or night people. If they liked to play golf or swim. What they thought their salary should be? He encouraged them to leave meetings they didnât find helpful. He asked them to do the work on their terms but responsibly. He recognized that motivated middle managers wasnât enough. Everyone had to be motivated. He created a thriving business culture where the dialogue was boss and peopleâs aspirations and families and feelings mattered.</p>

                            <p>Long Beach, California had a car plant that was run by Ford. They decided to bring in Japanese management coaches. The Japanese did two things differently. Firstly they held an event each month where everyone in the factory came to dinner. The whole family was invited. That created a bond bigger than the factory floor and work. It fostered community.</p>

                            <p>And secondly they got the white collar workers to speak to the blue collar workers about their experience working together. The blue collar workers knew the machinery and its pitfalls. They worked it day in and day out. This dialogue was a game changer. Instead of the white collar workers just telling the blue collar workers what to do, a back and forth between the two camps was born and this increased the self-esteem and self worth of the guys working the factory floor. They were being listened to and honored. Not just barked cold orders.</p>

                            <p>The emotional intelligence increased and so did the general happiness and productivity of the plant.</p>

                            <p>These are but two examples of mores that recognized that people matter. Mores that embraced emotional intelligence, mores that elevated, impacted and inspired. Such shifts can put mankind on a new course. They can, and do, turn the tide in the world.</p>

                            <p>At sutranovum we look at the authorities that rule our minds and question if they are liberated of fear and if they have fully employed imagination.</p>

                            <p>Imagination, literally. means to "picture to oneself."</p>

                                <p>There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures.

To turn the tracks to which he is tied in the direction in which he wants to go, he must put off his former conversation, which is called in the Bible the Old Man, and be renewed in the spirit of his mind. Speech is the image of mind; therefore, TO CHANGE HIS MIND, HE MUST FIRST CHANGE HIS SPEECH. BY 'SPEECH' IS MEANT THOSE MENTAL CONVERSATIONS WE CARRY ON WITH OURSELVES."</i></p>
